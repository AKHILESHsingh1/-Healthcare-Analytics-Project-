# 🏥 Hospital Patient Waiting List Dashboard (2018–2021)

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing **hospital patient waiting lists** using **Power BI**, helping healthcare administrators monitor trends, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Analyzed national **patient waiting list data (2018–2021)**  
- Designed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to track:  
  - Case Types → Inpatient, Outpatient, Day Case  
  - Age Profiles → 0–15, 16–64, 65+  
  - Waiting Time Bands → 0–3 months to 18+ months  
  - Specialties → Paediatrics, ENT, Orthopaedics, Dermatology, Cardiology, etc.  
- Delivered both **summary KPIs** and **detailed drilldowns** for deeper insights.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Track the **current status of waiting lists** across hospitals  
2. Study **monthly trends** for patient admissions (2018–2021)  
3. Highlight **specialty-level bottlenecks** and **age-based waiting disparities**  
4. Support **data-driven decisions** for resource allocation  

---

## 📊 Key Metrics & Visuals
- **KPIs**: Current Waiting List (709K), Last Year’s Waitlist (640K), Avg/Median Waiting Times  
- **Trends**: Inpatient vs Outpatient monthly fluctuations  
- **Specialty Analysis**: Top 5 affected specialties (Paediatric Dermatology, ENT, Orthopaedics, Cardiology, A&E)  
- **Age & Time-Band Analysis**: Older patients (65+) show longer waiting times (12+ months)  

---

## ⚡ Insights
- Outpatients form the **largest share** of the waiting list (~0.5M–0.63M).  
- **Day Cases & Inpatients** had higher fluctuations, especially in 2019 & mid-2020.  
- **Senior patients (65+)** are most affected by long delays.  
- Specialty backlogs reveal **critical areas needing immediate attention**.
